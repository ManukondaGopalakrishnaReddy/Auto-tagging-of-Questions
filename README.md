# Auto-tagging-of-Questions
Integration of Machine Learning Model for auto-tagging questions in Assessment Platform.

This project aims to integrate machine learning models for auto-tagging questions in an assessment platform and deploy the system on a local web page. The automated tagging system will predict and assign tags to Questions, including Difficulty Level, Bloom's Taxonomy, Category, and Sub-Category. By seamlessly integrating the models with a local web page, question authors and test-takers will experience an efficient and user-friendly platform.
